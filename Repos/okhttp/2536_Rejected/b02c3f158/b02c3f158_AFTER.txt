 * This request body involves an application thread only. First all bytes are written to the buffer.

 * <p>This stream has two special powers. First, it can retransmit the same request body multiple
 * times in order to recover from failures or cope with redirects. Second, it can compute the total
 * length of the request body by measuring it after it has been written to the output stream.
